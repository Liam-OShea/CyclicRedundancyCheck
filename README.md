# CyclicRedundancyCheck
a) Given a bit string, compute the CRC remainder and generate the bit string to be transmitted
b) Given a bit string with CRC remainder appended, divide by G(X) to determine if message is error free
c) Use these method in a test program which accepts G(X) and M(X), introduces random errors in P(X), and demonstrate how receiver is able to detect the error.
